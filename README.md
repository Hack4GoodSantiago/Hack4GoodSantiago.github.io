## Installation

If you want to use this site as a template for your hack4good city site just:

* Fork this repo (if you already have an old version and you just want to update it, merge changes from [release branch](https://github.com/Hack4GoodSantiago/Hack4GoodSantiago.github.io/tree/release)).

* Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/):

        gem install jekyll

* Run it:

        jekyll serve --watch

* Customize your city data and push it into your master branch, after that it will be live on your github page (in this case should be http://hack4goodsantiago.github.io).
